# Encourage.me

On the Peer Counseling Helpline [which I've talked about here](https://github.com/TinasheMTapera/PCHGmail), one important tool we learn about is Encouragement. As an Active Listening Skill, it is invaluable for helping peers explore their feelings and discuss where their mind is going. As an everyday talking point, it's an awesome way to pick someone up when they're down, and give them the motivation they need to get through a tough time. 

A friend (JJ) once went to the trouble of writing a whole bunch of encouragers for me when I was really struggling emotionally. These kinds of heartfelt gestures are quite meaningful, and I wanted to reciprocate the thought in my own way. In this project, I've written a very simple Python script that generates not only the encouragers that she wrote, but also a large number of encouragements from other sources as well! I've included some quotes from movies and TV that she likes, some from movies and TV that I like, novels, famous faces in history, and the Bible. I've also included lyrics from some of my favourite songs that do a number of different jobs for the psyche: some are explorations of feelings, others are braggadocious self affirmations, and others still are encouragements from that musician to the listener.

I hope that in any case, these encouragers can be helpful on a rainy day like they notecards were for me.

The real challenge in this project was experimenting with GUI development with the `Tkinter` module in Python 3.x. I quite liked `Tkinter`, but am still struggling to find a way to perfect distribution of the eventual executable using `Pyinstaller`. Hopefully I'll figure it out soon so that *anyone* can use this utility, but in the mean time, just follow these instructions:

1. Download both the `EncourageMe.py` file and the `Quotes.csv` file. Save them on your desktop.
2. Open the `Terminal` app. You can do this by searching for Terminal in the spotlight menu, or by going to your Applications folder.
3. In the Terminal window, simply type: `python ~/Desktop/EncourageMe.py` (don't be intimidated!)
4. Enjoy your birthday present! Simply hit the red button when you're done!
